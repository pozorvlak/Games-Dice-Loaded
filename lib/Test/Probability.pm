=head1 NAME

Test::Probability - test if results are distributed correctly

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::Probability;

  my @results;
  for (0 .. 1000) {
	$results[rand_fn()]++;
  }
  my @probabilities = (0.5, 0.2, 0.3);
  my $confidence = 0.9;
  dist_ok(@results, @probabilities, $confidence,
    "results match expected with confidence $confidence");
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Does your random-number generating function output the distribution you expect?
Now you can find out! This module performs a chi-squared test at the specified
confidence interval.
